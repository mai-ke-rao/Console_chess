-If user gives invalid input he gets notified and loses his move.
-inputs are regular chess inputs. (as per https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/chess.html)
-No rocades. ( Its conundrum because as I cant instantiate class object inside its own class
and aparrently I cant pass it to my resolver swich case function either because it requires
both rook and king pieces to be passed.)
-No checkmate, you have to eat enemy king.
-few rare special moves ommited for now.
